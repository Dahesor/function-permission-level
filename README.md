# Function Permission Level

This is a simple mod that changes the function-permission-level to 4 in integrated servers (i.e. single player and LAN).

The mod is _intended_ for data pack developers that are making data packs that go into servers to be tested easily in single player or LAN worlds. The creator of this mod does not encourage you to use this as a runtime mod.

## Notes

This mod only changes the permission level in integrated servers, and thus only affects single player and LAN worlds. Installing it on servers has no effects.

On servers, you can simply change the `function-permission-level` option in `server.properties` to achieve the same effect.
