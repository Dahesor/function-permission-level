# Function Permission Level

This is a simple mod that changes the function-permission-level to 4 in integrated servers (i.e. single player and LAN).

The mod is _intended_ for data pack developers that are making data packs that go into servers to be tested easily in single player or LAN worlds. The creater of this mod does not encourge you to use this as a runtime mod.

## Notes

This is a client side mod. It only changes the permission level in integrated servers, and thus only affects single player and LAN worlds. Installing it on servers has on effects.

On servers, you can simply change the `function-permission-level` option in server.properties to achive the same effect.
